                Rogan began his career in comedy in August 1988 in the Boston area. After relocating to Los Angeles in 1994, he signed an exclusive developmental deal with Disney, and appeared as an actor on several television shows including Hardball and NewsRadio. 
                In 1997, he started working for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) as an interviewer and color commentator. 
                Rogan released his first comedy special in 2000. In 2001, he put his comedy career on hold after becoming the host of Fear Factor, and resumed his stand-up career shortly after the show's end in 2006.
                In 2009, Rogan launched his podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, which led him to "fame, wealth and podcast superstardom"

                Joseph James Rogan was born on August 11, 1967, in Newark, New Jersey. His grandfather had moved his family there in the 1940s. He is of three-quarters Italian and one-quarter Irish descent. His father, Joseph, is a former police officer in Newark.
                Rogan's parents divorced when he was five, and he has not been in contact with his father since he was seven. 
                Rogan recalled: "All I remember of my dad are these brief, violent flashes of domestic violence ... But I don't want to complain about my childhood. 
                Nothing bad ever really happened to me ... I don't hate the guy."[8] From ages 7 to 11, the family lived in San Francisco, California,[8] followed by a move to Gainesville, Florida when he was eleven.
                 They settled outside Boston in Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts, where Rogan attended Newton South High School, from which he graduated in 1985.

            Born and raised in Ohio, he develops an interest in music early on. In high school his two big hobbies are basketball and base and guitar in a heavy metal band. 
            As the band starts to become known locally, Jamie and his band got to play their biggest gig, opening for the progressive hard rock band Mudvayne. 
            It was at this point that Jamie and his band had to decide whether they want to fully pursue their dream of becoming pros, or leave it be. 
            Being asked in an interview if they were good enough, Jamie snickers: ‘I did think…now I laugh’.
            </p>
            <p>
            Despite gaining local fame, Jamie decides to leave the band and get into audio recording as a way of staying closing to the band and to music.
            He goes on to do a 1 year audio engineering course at Ohio State, thinking he would later work for a big recording studio.
